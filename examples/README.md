# MCP SDK Examples

This directory contains various examples of how to use the PHP MCP SDK.

You can run examples 01-08 with the dependencies already installed in the root directory of the SDK. For example 09, see the
README in the `examples/09-standalone-cli` directory.

For running an example, you execute the `server.php` like this:
```bash
# For examples using STDIO transport
php examples/01-discovery-stdio-calculator/server.php

# For examples using Streamable HTTP transport
php -S localhost:8000 examples/02-discovery-http-userprofile/server.php
```

You will see debug outputs to help you understand what is happening.

Run with Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector php examples/01-discovery-stdio-calculator/server.php
```

## Debugging

You can enable debug output by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable to `1`, and additionally log to a file by
setting the `FILE_LOG` environment variable to `1` as well. A `dev.log` file gets written within the example's
directory.

With the Inspector you can set the environment variables like this:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector -e DEBUG=1 -e FILE_LOG=1 php examples/01-discovery-stdio-calculator/server.php
```
